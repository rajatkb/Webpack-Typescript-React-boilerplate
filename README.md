# 🚀 Webpack-Typescript-React-boilerplate

It's a boilerplate for React , with Typescript bundling along with working CSS modules support. The boilerplate is good for bundling single page applications.

  Nope , it's just a configuration thats minimal in nature and only does what's important nothing else.
